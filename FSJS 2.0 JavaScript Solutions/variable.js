let p = 'Are you coder'; //String

console.log("p has data type called", typeof(p),"Then value is",p);

// Then Output be like:
// p has data type called string Then value is Are you coder
// r has data type called boolean Then value is true
// a has data type called undefined Then value is undefined   
// j has data type called object Then value is null
