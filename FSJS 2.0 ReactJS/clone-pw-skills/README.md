Hello all😍!

Here is a clone of PW (PhysicsWallah) -skills site🚀 that uses ReactJs and TailwindCSS only!!
In the process of creating this page, I learned so many things I didn't know and also get answers to many questions. Now React is my favorite topic to learn.

In this coding process, I learned about JSX, Arrow function, react objects, spread, multiple props, and using the same component more than once.

Also implemented responsive tailwind CSS, which means that it is compatible with all devices from 3XL to Sm(😉)
